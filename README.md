# Enchanté 🐱‍💻
I'm a Full-Stack Developer working remotly (mostly from home) 👋

## What I do 🤓
I'm working at the company that i founded back in 2016 ([Farbenfroh - German word for "colorful"](https://www.sei-farbenfroh.de)). We're a small team and most of the time we do classic consulting. I'd say i have a startup mind and i'm always seeking for good business ideas. If we're not helping other businesses achieving wonderful stuff we're implementing our own SaaS businesses. We're always bootstraping 💸 and don't aim to be the next unicorn 🦄.

## What i'm using daily 💻
- Spring Boot (`.kt`, `.java`)
- React (`.tsx`)
- Terraform
- Kubernetes + Docker
- GitLab + GitHub
- AWS
- Databases (mostyl PSQL, sometimes Mongo)

I'm highly interested in the intersection between (home) automation and agriculture (ie. smartfarming), ERP software and infrastructure automation. I also like F1 🏎️ and i'm a potterhead ⚡.
